<h1 align="center"> WELCOME TO MY RESUME LANDING PAGE </h1> 

## <h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I´m Pedro Robinet and this is my first official project implementing my knowledge related with <bold>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</bold>.</p>

## <h2> Build information </h2>
<p>For this project I´m using the grid system and some basic classes and JS behaviours from <bold>Bootstrap framework</bold> but changing or adding specific style and things to most of them by myself through CSS and JavaScript. I did this to show my proffesor that I have an understanding about the languages and framework mentioned above.
<bold>For a cleanner and optimized code </bold>it will be better to use more tools from Bootstrap framework or not including it and do the grid system and some stylish by myself.</p>

## <h2> Responsive information </h2>
It has a responsive design with <bold>specific breakpoints</bold>. This ones are not picked randomly. I have been doing a research and reading stadistics about the most commons dispositives and screen sizes that users use to surf in the web.
The breakpoints in matter are:
<bold>1366px</bold> (Notebook/Desktop)
<bold>810px</bold> (Tablet)
<bold>414px</bold> (Mobile)
