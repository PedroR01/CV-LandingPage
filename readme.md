<h1 align="center"> WELCOME TO MY RESUME LANDING PAGE </h1> 

## <h2> Introduction </h2>
Hi everyone, I´m Pedro Robinet and this is my first official project implementing my knowledge related with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

## <h2> Build information </h2>
For this project I´m using the grid system and some basic classes and JS behaviours from Bootstrap **framework** but changing or adding specific style and things to most of them by myself through CSS and JavaScript. I did this to show my proffesor that I have an understanding about the languages and framework mentioned above.<br>
**For a cleanner and optimized code** it will be better to use more tools from Bootstrap framework or not including it and do the grid system and some stylish by myself.

## <h2> Responsive information </h2>
It has a responsive design with **specific breakpoints**. This ones are not picked randomly. I have been doing a research and reading stadistics about the most commons dispositives and screen sizes that users use to surf in the web.
The breakpoints in matter are: <br>
- **1366px** (Notebook/Desktop)<br>
- **810px** (Tablet) <br>
- **414px** (Mobile) <br> <br>

In case you are using **Brave browser** it is recommended that you disable the brave shields. If they are not deactivated, some elements may not load correctly, such as the font.
